			<li>Bio: After her son took her place as High King of their people, Lorna was left feeling useless and restless. Looking for something new and exciting she decided to give her land legs a stretch. Hearing of a university on a distant mountain she made her way there. Finding the place to be hospitable and quite perfect to begin her new life, she and the university founder started a small community at the base of the mountain in a little vally secluded from most of the world and allowing for privacy for the many different people of the non-human variety, though humans accepting of the magic, demonic, and everyone else were also welcomed. Soon the town was in full swing and Lorna took on her new role as town Mayor.</li>

                        <li>Bio: After his home forest was developed by some Japanese businesses he needed to find a new place to live. Japan had lost it's beauty and purity in his eyes so he took to searching elsewhere. After hearing of a little place tucked into the mountains that would be perfect for someone like him, he made his way there. It took a little while but eventually he managed to put up the 1st 'bar' and was happy to see it full up with the students from the university as well as the newcomers that slowly began finding the hidden town. He now happily serves and flirts in his established place of business and has become one of the more well known people in the town</li>

                        <li>Bio: Illandrathyl is of royal blood, but his entire village and family was killed by a drow invasion into his homeland. In an effort to take revenge, he attempted to summon a demon but the summoning failed. The summoned demon was powerful, and was able to remain on the material plane long enough to cast a curse upon Illandrathyl. He was banished to Candlewick Falls. He awoke one day without knowing where he was. He tried to leave, but as soon as he was away from the building he awoke in he began to feel physically weak and eventually passed out. Ever since that time, he has been in the town and tended the cafe. He's shy and has a reserved demeanor, but that doesn't mean he's afraid to take what he wants. His age allows him the ability to be less afraid of things that would seem unearthly to other folk. </li>

                        <li>Bio: Belial was once one of the favored by God, the Almighty. He fell into bad graces because of the fundamental ideology of non-interference that God held in regards to the mortal realm. He was caught providing divine interference, and sentenced to live out the rest of eternity among the Mortals. Bel wandered the globe for many years, until he came across Candlewick Falls. At the time of his arrival, there was nothing here. It was a couple of houses and very minimal farm land. He took it upon himself to shape the land and the atmosphere. He, and a couple of others became the founders of Candlewick Falls and he was put in charge of the University. It intrigued him as the ultimate betrayal of the rules he held in such disdain. Here he was able to shape minds and change lives in whatever way he wished. The manipulation of impressionable beings quickly became one of his favorite pastimes, and things change at the University as easily as his whims.</li>

                        <li>Bio: Emma grew up in a rich family with two other sisters. Her family was one of wealth and held quite the position of power on their home world. Throughout the years and with the help of her family's fortune, Emma modified her body to deal with any sexual encounter she could. Equipped with the top of the line body modifications, Emma traveled her home world participating in orgies and parties alike. Unfortunately, with each body mod, her artificial libido would build the more altered her system became. A small price to pay she though. 

One day while she was away in a trip, a band of roving marauders attacked their home world and invaded for their natural resources. Unable to repel the attack, the citizens were forced to relocate. She hopped on the first shuttle headed off planet and hoped for the best, leaving everything she knew and loved behind.

After traveling for so long and using her body and skills to pay for mostly everything she needed, she found herself here. A new place for her to explore. It's been years since the incident and she now assumed everyone she knew was passed on. It was time for her to settle down and make a new life for herself.</li>
