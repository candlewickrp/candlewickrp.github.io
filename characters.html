			<li>Bio: After her son took her place as High King of their people, Lorna was left feeling useless and restless. Looking for something new and exciting she decided to give her land legs a stretch. Hearing of a university on a distant mountain she made her way there. Finding the place to be hospitable and quite perfect to begin her new life, she and the university founder started a small community at the base of the mountain in a little vally secluded from most of the world and allowing for privacy for the many different people of the non-human variety, though humans accepting of the magic, demonic, and everyone else were also welcomed. Soon the town was in full swing and Lorna took on her new role as town Mayor.</li>

                        <li>Bio: After his home forest was developed by some Japanese businesses he needed to find a new place to live. Japan had lost it's beauty and purity in his eyes so he took to searching elsewhere. After hearing of a little place tucked into the mountains that would be perfect for someone like him, he made his way there. It took a little while but eventually he managed to put up the 1st 'bar' and was happy to see it full up with the students from the university as well as the newcomers that slowly began finding the hidden town. He now happily serves and flirts in his established place of business and has become one of the more well known people in the town</li>

                        <li>Bio: Illandrathyl is of royal blood, but his entire village and family was killed by a drow invasion into his homeland. In an effort to take revenge, he attempted to summon a demon but the summoning failed. The summoned demon was powerful, and was able to remain on the material plane long enough to cast a curse upon Illandrathyl. He was banished to Candlewick Falls. He awoke one day without knowing where he was. He tried to leave, but as soon as he was away from the building he awoke in he began to feel physically weak and eventually passed out. Ever since that time, he has been in the town and tended the cafe. He's shy and has a reserved demeanor, but that doesn't mean he's afraid to take what he wants. His age allows him the ability to be less afraid of things that would seem unearthly to other folk. </li>

He fell into bad graces because of the fundamental ideology of non-interference that God held in regards to the mortal realm. He was caught providing divine interference, and sentenced to live out the rest of eternity among the Mortals. Bel wandered the globe for many years, until he came across Candlewick Falls. At the time of his arrival, there was nothing here. It was a couple of houses and very minimal farm land. He took it upon himself to shape the land and the atmosphere. He, and a couple of others became the founders of Candlewick Falls and he was put in charge of the University. It intrigued him as the ultimate betrayal of the rules he held in such disdain. Here he was able to shape minds and change lives in whatever way he wished. The manipulation of impressionable beings quickly became one of his favorite pastimes, and things change at the University as easily as his whims.</li>

			<li>Bio: Emma grew up in a rich family with two other sisters. Her family was one of wealth and held quite the position of power on their home world. Throughout the years and with the help of her family's fortune, Emma modified her body to deal with any sexual encounter she could. Equipped with the top of the line body modifications, Emma traveled her home world participating in orgies and parties alike. Unfortunately, with each body mod, her artificial libido would build the more altered her system became. A small price to pay she though.</br> 

One day while she was away in a trip, a band of roving marauders attacked their home world and invaded for their natural resources. Unable to repel the attack, the citizens were forced to relocate. She hopped on the first shuttle headed off planet and hoped for the best, leaving everything she knew and loved behind.
</br>
After traveling for so long and using her body and skills to pay for mostly everything she needed, she found herself here. A new place for her to explore. It's been years since the incident and she now assumed everyone she knew was passed on. It was time for her to settle down and make a new life for herself.</li>

Danior was the product of the attack and though his mother died in child birth, his grandfather did his best to raise him well and of the gypsy way, even if the rest of the troupe thought he was cursed. He always knew he was different than others but it wasn't until around puberty that his wolf began to come out. One night while asleep his troupe were attacked by a rival troupe. In the fray he went full wolf and killed every person of the rival troupe, but not before they killed his grandfather. This left his group fearful of him and he was run off. After managing to steal back a few of his possessions, he went off on his own to learn about his curse and survive alone. He never lost his gypsy ways though and began turning tricks of sex and entertainment in any city he passed through. Not to mention being an excellent pick pocket.</li>

She initially had a knack for it thanks to some old which blood from some distant ancestors. One of her highschool teachers, who was actually secretly a practicing warlock, took to her as he sensed her dormant powers. He did what he could to help guide her. At the end of her senior year he gave her a familiar to help protect and continue guiding her. It was a baby white snake, an animal she holds very dear to her even I'd she isn't fully aware of what it actually is. Along with the snake her teacher gave her advice on a special university to attend that could cater to her specific interests. And so, she applied and was accepted and will be beginning her harrowing freshmen year at the spooky university in the mountains.</li>

Some being meek, others being demanding, while a few brought out her deeper calling, bringing back instincts and flash backs of her past, which lead to a black out, and usually she would find herself tied to a post, stripped naked and her belongings hidden away, which she could easily sniff out, finding herself alone most of these times concerned her, but she always thought her "partner" had up and left. She never paid much mind to it. And, this is Allison, sweet, loyal, affectionate. But nature is nature and most know not to tamper with what they dont know.</li>

                        <li>Bio: Lexi was an elf whose home was destroyed in a bandit raid. Her mother managed to escape with her as a baby, and from then on they travelled from city to city. Her mother would provide healing to anyone that could afford it, and when not working she taught Lexi all about magic. Once she was old enough to set out on her own, Lexi travelled the world. At first, she set out to learn all she could about destruction magic and how to effectively use it in combat. Once mastered, she began adventuring. Exploring abandoned tombs and finding treasures buried deep within. Tired of that way of life though, she decided to try something a bit different. She began traveling from town to town and prostituting herself off. Mostly just for fun. This helped her develop people skills, and taught her more than just a few things about sex. Now wanting something different, Lexi is taking her savings and writing to Candlewick to sit back and enjoy herself for as long as her money lasts.</li>

                        <li>Bio: Jesse was created by a perverted mage thousands of years ago. Since it was created by pure magic, Jesse has no need to eat, sleep, or drink. Jesse can’t die from old age, however it can die from the same means as mortals. Jesse can get sick, bleed out, get beheaded, stabbed, and so on. Jesse was created as a shapeshifting being originally to be used strictly for the purposes of sex. After a few years of that being it’s entire life though, Jesse killed the mage that had made it and set of on its own. Through its travels, Jesse has learned a lot about the world, and has gotten pretty good with a sword. Now Jesse travels to CWF to see what the town has to offer, and maybe become a permanent resident.</li>
